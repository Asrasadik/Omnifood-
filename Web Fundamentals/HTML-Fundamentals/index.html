    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using
        three fundamental technologies: HTML,
        CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>

        <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML
             is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup
            language that web developers use to structure and describe
            the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>

            <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types
                of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc.
                Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>

                <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
